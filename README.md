# Middle Earth Remastered Repo

# Archive
 * Please note - this project is no longer being maintained
 * I started this back in 2016 when I retyped every existing card in Magic Set Editor to allow for clear readable text
 * I created a custom fork of MSE in 2018 to update it to allow for 300dpi image export
 * As a result of updating MSE for higher resolutions, I created these new Card Frames to replace existing scans
 * We then updated all cards with the new frames and errata
 * I have completed everything I set out to - and multiple other places have since created their own remasters
 * This repo is now archived - CardNum has become the main place of play and source of card art for proxies.
